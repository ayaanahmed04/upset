# UPSET Project Status

**Last updated:** September 13, 2026

**Current phase:** Phase 1 — Data Foundation

**Current development day:** Day 1/2

## Project Goal

Build a professional UFC analytics and machine learning platform that serves as both a real public product and a flagship portfolio project.

## Career Focus

Primary:

- Data Science / Machine Learning

Secondary:

- Software Engineering / Backend / Full Stack

Additional:

- Data Analytics

## Current Technical Decisions

- Python 3.12
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Private GitHub repository during initial development
- UFC-only scope for v1
- Analytics/research platform positioning
- Betting-specific functionality deferred until later
- Public web application planned
- Historical dataset used for local data science and ML development
- Provider-independent internal data model planned
- Raw source data remains immutable
- Fighter names will not be used as permanent unique identifiers
- Multiple data providers may be used for different purposes
- Cito is a candidate for early API experimentation
- UFCalendar is a candidate for future application/update ingestion
- SportsDataIO and Sportradar remain possible future production-grade providers
- Tapology and Sherdog are validation/research sources rather than automated ingestion sources

## Completed

- Created private GitHub repository `ayaanahmed04/upset`
- Cloned repository to `~/Projects/upset`
- Configured GitHub CLI authentication
- Configured Git identity with personal email
- Installed Python 3.12.14 with Homebrew
- Created and verified `.venv`
- Configured `.gitignore`
- Created initial project structure
- Added `ROADMAP.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`
- Created `src/upset`, `tests`, `notebooks`, and data directories
- Added `pyproject.toml`
- Added NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib
- Added pytest, Ruff, and JupyterLab development tooling
- Installed UPSET as an editable Python package
- Added first import test
- Verified pytest passes: `1 passed`
- Verified Ruff passes: `All checks passed`
- Researched UFC data-source options and licensing/access considerations
- Established initial source strategy
- Downloaded José Silva UFC 1994–2026 Kaggle dataset
- Stored raw files under `data/raw/kaggle_ufc_1994_2026/`
- Verified raw dataset is ignored by Git
- Created `notebooks/01_data_audit.ipynb`
- Configured notebook to use project `.venv` Python 3.12.14 kernel
- Loaded fighter dataset: 4,455 rows × 18 columns
- Loaded fight dataset: 8,551 rows × 37 columns
- Audited fighter-profile missingness
- Identified substantial missing reach, stance, DOB, height, and weight data
- Identified suspicious zero-valued career statistics requiring semantic validation
- Confirmed fight-data coverage from 1994-03-11 through 2026-03-07
- Confirmed no duplicate `Fighter_URL` records
- Confirmed no duplicate `Fight_URL` records
- Confirmed all 2,647 unique fighters appearing in fight rows have a matching fighter-profile name
- Identified 1,801 profile-only fighter names requiring later investigation
- Identified seven fighter-name collisions representing distinct people
- Established that fighter names cannot safely serve as permanent unique identifiers
- Identified structural control-time missingness in early UFC history
- Found strong evidence that control-time coverage begins around UFC 21 on 1999-07-16
- Established a working assumption that pre-UFC-21 control-time zeros may represent unavailable data rather than true zero control
- Confirmed raw source data should remain unchanged and corrections should occur during processing/normalization

## Current Data Findings

The current historical dataset contains:

- 4,455 fighter-profile rows
- 4,448 unique fighter names
- 8,551 fight rows
- 2,647 unique fighters appearing in the fight table
- 1,801 fighter names present only in the profile table
- Historical fight coverage from 1994-03-11 through 2026-03-07

Known data-quality concerns include:

- Reach is missing for approximately 43.5% of fighter profiles
- Stance is missing for approximately 19.1%
- DOB is missing for approximately 11.4%
- Some career-statistic zeros may represent unavailable data rather than legitimate zero values
- Control-time values appear structurally unavailable for early UFC events
- Fighter names are not globally unique
- The fight dataset contains fight-level totals rather than true round-level rows
- The historical dataset is already several months behind current UFC events

## Current Task

Complete source validation and formally establish UPSET's initial historical data strategy.

The Kaggle dataset currently appears suitable as a historical development and ML snapshot, but not as UPSET's permanent live production source.

## Next Steps — Day 2/3

1. Finish and summarize the Kaggle dataset audit
2. Formally decide whether to adopt the Kaggle dataset as UPSET's initial historical development dataset
3. Investigate the scope of the 1,801 profile-only fighters
4. Evaluate Cito's UFC API and data schema
5. Compare overlapping fighter and fight records across sources
6. Begin defining UPSET's canonical data model
7. Plan fighter-ID mapping and source provenance tracking
8. Continue evaluating UFCalendar as a future live/update data provider
9. Determine how round-level statistics will be acquired for future metrics such as cardio and pace decay

## Blockers

No major blockers.

Known data-quality issues are being documented and will be handled through normalization and validation rather than by modifying raw source files.
